SPIKE is a protocol fuzzer creation kit. It provides an API that allows a user to create their own fuzzers for network based protocols using the C++ programming language. The tool defines a number of primitives that it makes available to C coders, which allows it to construct fuzzed messages called “SPIKES” that can be sent to a network service to hopefully induce errors. SPIKE was specifically designed to focus on finding exploitable bugs, so it’s an excellent choice for our purposes.  SPIKE also includes a simple scripting capability, and within the SPIKE distribution, there are a few command line tools which can act as interpreters to simple text files containing SPIKE primitives.
现在immunitysec.com上都找不到spike的资源了，而且这种书上关于spike的资源的网址基本都无资源，不太清楚是怎么回事。
现在能找到git真香~
